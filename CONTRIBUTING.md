# Contribution Guidelines for Open Science Rules

This page was modified from the [deep-review contribution guidelines](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/blob/5e00ddd30d79f527129de25ef02566a39bd6358d/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Issues

We use issues to discuss open science `rules`, relevant `papers`, open science `examples`, and `other` relevant topics.
Please make sure to use the [appropriate label](https://github.com/carpenterlab/open-science-rules/labels) to catalog a new issue.

## Manuscript Writing via Manubot

[`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md) describes information on how to use Manubot for writing the manuscript.

### Pull Requests

Contributions to the text happens via a [pull request model](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).
All participants should feel free to participate in reviewing pull requests (see [Peer Review](#Peer-Review) below).

Make your voice heard!
We'd love to have you ask questions, clarify points, and jump in and edit the text.

### Authorship

We use the [ICMJE Guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html).
We expect authors to contribute to the overall design by participating in issues, to contribute to the text by writing sections and/or revising sections through pull requests.
To be considered for authorship, these should be substantial intellectual contributions.

### Peer Review

All pull requests will undergo peer review.
Participants in this project should review proposed changes (pull requests), which can be done using [GitHub's review interface](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/ "GitHub: about pull request reviews").
Pull requests are used to suggest modifications.
Users can also directly edit pull requests to make suggested changes.

As a reviewer, it's helpful to note the type of review you performed:

* Did you read cited literature?
* Did you look over the text in detail?
* Are you in support of the rule?

Before a repository maintainer merges a pull request, there must be at least one affirmative review.
If there is any unaddressed criticism or disapproval, a repository maintainer will determine how to proceed and may wait for additional feedback.

### Maintainer

If you'd like to help with repository maintenance, file a pull request and add your name and github profile!
